This repo is created for Web 3 Practicum JavaScript case.

I would have been going to done OOP case with TypeScript but I realized that the time is not enough when I've considered the remain time.

## Case

**Language**: JavaScript

**Case Detail**: Create a function that determines whether a number is Odd or Even. \
A number is odd if the sum of all its digits is odd, and a number if the sum of all its digits is even. \
If a number is odd, return "Odd". \
Otherwise, return "Even".  \
For example:

oddishOrEvenish(43) ➞ "Odd" \
// 4 + 3 = 7 \
// 7 % 2 = 1 \

oddishOrEvenish(373) ➞ "Odd" \
// 3 + 7 + 3 = 13 \
// 13 % 2 = 1 \

oddishOrEvenish(4433) ➞ "Even" \
// 4 + 4 + 3 + 3 = 14 \
// 14 % 2 = 0
